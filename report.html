I have designed a responsive website in the form of a topical magazine. This is a lifestyle magazine consisted of different categories including Food, Beauty and Lifestyle. These are divided into sub-categories: Travel; Art and Museums; Fashion; Culture. The Lifestyle Magazine is called Women's Mode so the targeted audience is females who are interested in health, wellbeing and growing theirselves.

There has been a few different websites that have inspired me to create my own website. The website "Elle" has inspired me with the artciles and how they have been written, whereas the website "Women's Health" has helped me with the name. On the other hand, a different magazine site, "Glamour," has inspired me with the style of photos.

Accessibility of a website is important because it improves the experience for mobile users. My website is accessible in many different ways, including: headers to structure my content correctly by using semantic tags in HTML; usage of colour contrast between text and background; all forms on my website have proper form labels - "get in touch" has placeholder text for name, email, subject and message. The Email has to be correct with a '@' included, otherwise the message would not send.

Web usability’ basically means how easy it is for someone to use and navigate a website. Although it is quite a broad term, web usability can be narrowed down to a few key aspects – the simplicity, consistency, familiarity, relevancy and accessibility of a site. In short, website usability is essentially focused on making a website more user-friendly. Different ways in which I have considered usability in my site: navigation - most of the users access the websites from their mobile devices apart from desktops and laptops. Therefore, I made sure that my users are able to navigate my website easily on their mobile devices as well; selection of images and their placement - I have used high quality and relevant images on my site. I chose my images carefully so that they immediately appeal to my target audience and make the necessary impact on them. For example, I have used images of beaches and cities for travel articles; simplicity - I have focused on what's important since I would not want to distract my vistors so they can do what they want to do. I have also created a consistent experience across my entire website to keep my visitors mind at ease.

Things I had to learn myself was how to use a Bootstrap, how to make a Breadcrumb Navigation, and how to code plugins in js. I have researched thoroughly on Google and Youtube to find out how all worked out. I researched how I can create my own website and what I came across was to use Bootstrap [2]. It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. I have customised the existing Bootstrap styles for example the colours and the border. I have also changed the grid layout (gutter width) to make it as unique as possible.

I have used plugins in a standard JavaScript file and have used it along with jQuery library method. I have used a lightweight jQuery plugin that counts up to a targeted number when the number becomes visible [8]. In order to suit my website, I changed the counts to a different targeted number. It now seems more popular and up-to-date. I have used a JavaScript library called Waypoints [9] to make it easy to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element by changing the elements and the sizes to fit my website. I have used Magnific Popup [10] for my articles, changing the images and the text. To scroll up, I have used a 'scrollUp js' [11] but have changed the scroll speed to make it more accessible. I have used a simple jQuery ticker plugin [13], changing the times and the opacity. One other jQuery plugin I have used was to create responsive carousel sliders [4], what I have changed was the padding and the postiton, adding images.

Another thing I have learned by myself was using Breadcrumbs [2] to enhance the way users find their way around by improving the findability of website sections and pages. Breadcrumbs reduces clicks or actions for the user to return to higher-level categories more easily. I have coded the categories with topics related to my lifestyle magazine. I decided to make the breadcrumb update code as abstract as possible, so that it could be reused for each level of the breadcrumb hierarchy. I also used some JQuery.

One aspect of my work that worked well coding the Breadcrumb Navigation because it has made my wesbite look neater and has increased it's usability, allowing website users to recognize their hierarchy while reducing the number of steps required to reach a higher-level within the site. Other aspects of my work that worked well was using Bootstrap and the fonts [3] because it has made my site well organised and easy to understand.

The aspects of my work that could be improved are the information and images chosen. So what I would do differently another time is I can blog better quality information and images that can relate better together. To improve, another thing I can do is make the website less broad, directed to a niche audience so that I can write deeper about the topic.
